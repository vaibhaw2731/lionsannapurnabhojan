              At Lions Dhandhania Annapurna Bhojan, we believe that no one should go hungry. 
              Our mission is to provide nutritious meals to those in need at a nominal cost 
              of just â‚¹5, making food accessible to everyone while maintaining their dignity.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Through our network of dedicated volunteers and supporters, we serve hundreds 
              of meals daily, bringing hope and nourishment to our community.
